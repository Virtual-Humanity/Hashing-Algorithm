# Hashing-Algorithm
A hashing algorithm in Python.
Names: Angela McNeese and Monserrat Molina.
We used the latest version of Python which is 3.9.7.
The code was written in the IDLE of Python. 
The program was run on the command prompt Windows 10 using the command: 
python main.py
Once the program is running, it will ask the user for an input string. Once the user has inputted a string, the program will print out the 32 bit hash value of the string which satisfies Part 1 of the assignment. Part 2 of the assignment is randomly generating strings and their hash value until two hash values match using our brute force attack. Once two hash values match, then it means that a collision was found and the program will print out the number of steps it took for a collision to be found. The results of Part 2 are then used in our report as we analysis the results using the concept of the birthday attack.
